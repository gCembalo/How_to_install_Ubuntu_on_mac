# How to install Ubuntu on mac

I'll show how to install a VirtualMachine with Linux Ubuntu on it on your Mac. We are going to use UTM to create the VirtualMachine. This guide won't be a technical one, but for some informatics could be a little be naif; I will be very essential and I will explain just the basics to install Ubuntu on your M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac. If you have a Intel Mac you can find some usefull guide online to install a Linux Virtual Machine with your processor. <br>

First of all some basics information and terms that I'm going to use:
- VM : Virtual Machine.
- OS : Operating System.
- Linux image : we refer to an image of a Operating System when we talk about a file which contains all the information necessary to download and use a OS.
There are several option to create and use a VM on your Mac, but I choose to use UTM, which is easy to use, and most important thing, free to use. I also choose to install Ubuntu and no other version of Linux, just for personal preference. <br>

In this guide I'll show you some image from a pc to guide you easily, all the photos are taken from **Datastream** youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PL-0-5BNXs), which explain very well how to install Ubuntu on your Mac. I'll follow the same process of that video.
